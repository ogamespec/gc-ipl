Bootrom size is 2 MB.<br>
<br>
First logical part of bootrom (reset vector) called Bootstrap 1 (BS1). This small procedure is written on assembly. It prepare Gamecube hardware, checks memory and load second logical part, known as Bootstrap 2 (BS2) or IPL (Intial Program Loader).<br>
<br>
IPL is written on C. It compiled as DOL executable, by using early version Dolphin SDK as system API.<br>
Code entrypoint for start routine is made to 0x81300000 location, by link script.<br>
<br>
Important Note: Bootrom is encrypted itself. Decryption is done by MX chip, during block reading of bootrom data. Encryption algorithm was reversed by segher : <a href='Descrambler.md'>Descrambler</a>

Also Bootrom contain two sets of raster fonts. One for ANSI charset and another for SJIS:<br>

These fonts are rarely used by some games. Font data is <b>not</b> encrypted.<br>
<br>
When IPL starts, following sequence appear :<br>
<br>
First is rotating cube intro:<br>
